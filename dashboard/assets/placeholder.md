# Dashboard Assets

This directory contains visualization assets for the EV Adoption Analysis Dashboard.

During the actual execution of the analysis pipeline, visualization images will be automatically generated and saved here, including:

- Adoption rate trends
- Year-over-year growth charts
- EV sales volumes
- Charging infrastructure maps
- Correlation heatmaps
- Model predictions and feature importance
- Future projections

These visualizations are then displayed in the Streamlit dashboard.
