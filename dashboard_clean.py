        The electric vehicle market continues to demonstrate robust growth across all analyzed regions,

        - **Regional Variations**: The Northeast and West Coast regions show the highest adoption rates,
          likely due to stronger policy support and more developed charging infrastructure.
          
        - **Infrastructure Correlation**: Our analysis confirms a strong positive correlation between
          charging infrastructure density and EV adoption rates.
          
        - **Economic Factors**: Financial incentives remain a significant driver of adoption, with
          each $1,000 in incentives associated with approximately 0.7% increase in adoption rate.
          
        - **Future Outlook**: Projections indicate accelerating adoption through 2027, with the national
          average potentially reaching 15-20% of new vehicle sales, though regional variations will persist.

                ### Key Findings
                
                Based on the scenario parameters you selected:
                
                - The average EV adoption rate across all regions would change from 
                  **{avg_baseline:.2f}%** to **{avg_projected:.2f}%** ({pct_change:.1f}% change).
                  
                - The largest contributing factor to this change is 
                  **{'increased charging infrastructure' if charging_impact.mean() > max(incentive_impact.mean(), gas_price_impact.mean(), abs(carbon_impact.mean())) else
                    'financial incentives' if incentive_impact.mean() > max(charging_impact.mean(), gas_price_impact.mean(), abs(carbon_impact.mean())) else
                    'gas prices' if gas_price_impact.mean() > max(incentive_impact.mean(), charging_impact.mean(), abs(carbon_impact.mean())) else
                    'grid decarbonization'}**.
                  
                - Regions would experience different magnitudes of change, with the highest impact in
                  **{scenario_data.loc[scenario_data['projected_adoption_rate'] / scenario_data['adoption_rate'] - 1 == (scenario_data['projected_adoption_rate'] / scenario_data['adoption_rate'] - 1).max(), 'region'].values[0]}**.
